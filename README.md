# hackathon_jci

### A competition held by Junior Chamber International (JCI). We won did this project by group. 

This is a 3 days and 2 nights hackathon where every group were given representatives of 2 people from the village. Every Group had different problems because every group recieves different representatives from different villages. 
Our group got a problem where they want to make a meeting point between the growth of Small Medium Enterprise (SME) and the tourist attraction. While the tourist attraction experienced substantial growth, the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) remains relatively obscure. Which is why we made a solution by making a website where people from around Indonesia or even around the world, could buy SME products. In the website also include the purchase of the tourist attraction tickets.
